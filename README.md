# Roots-Shoots
The software system is being produced for a customer/vendor interested in buying/selling 
plants via the Internet and reading & uploading plant blogs. This system is designed to 
‚Äúprovide automation support‚Äù for the process of placing plants for sale on the Internet and 
facilitating the actual sale. This system is largely cross-platform and is available to anyone 
using the internet and interested in Gardening. The system will be run on a central server 
with each user having a remote user interface through a web browser to interact with it.
